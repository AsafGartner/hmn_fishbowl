# Handmade Network fishbowl topics

## How it works

* Topics are managed through the [Discussions](https://github.com/AsafGartner/hmn_fishbowl/discussions) feature on this repository.
* Anyone can create a discussion to suggest a topic. Descriptions are optional, but encouraged.
* Upvote topics that you think are interesting.
* If you have something to say about the topic and would like to participate in the #fishbowl channel, reply to the discussion with "Count me in".
* If you have questions or sub-topics that you would like to see addressed during the fishbowl, add them as replies to the discussion.
